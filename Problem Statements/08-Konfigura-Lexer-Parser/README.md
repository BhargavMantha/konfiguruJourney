## 💡 Month 8 Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
- Quality over speed
- Tests before implementation (TDD)
- Document as you build
- Commit frequently
- Ask for help when stuck

**Success Mindset:**
- Progress, not perfection
- Learn from mistakes
- Celebrate small wins
- Stay consistent
- Rest on Sundays

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Sunday = REST
Remember: Sunday is your sacred rest day. No work, no study. Recharge completely.

### Daily Rhythm
- Weekdays: 0.5-3 hours (varies by day)
- Saturday: 4 hours (deep work)
- Focus on consistency over intensity

### When Stuck
1. Review documentation
2. Check examples
3. Ask in communities (r/golang, r/kubernetes)
4. Use AI assistants for debugging
5. Take a break and return fresh

Don't suffer in silence. The community is here to help!
