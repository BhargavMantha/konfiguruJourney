# Day 003: LLVM IR study

**Month 13:** Intermediate Representation (IR) Design
**Phase:** Multi-Target
**Week:** 1 of 4 - IR Research & Design

---

## 🎯 Today's Goal

Continue working on LLVM IR study with focus on testing/review activities.

**What You'll Build:** LLVM IR study implementation with comprehensive tests

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn Today

**IR Theory, LLVM Study:**
- Core concepts for LLVM IR study
- Implementation patterns and best practices
- Testing strategies
- Integration with existing Konfiguru architecture

**Go Skills:**
- Advanced patterns (visitor, builder, strategy)
- Interface design for extensibility
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

## ✅ Today's Tasks

### Task 1: LLVM IR study - Part 1 (60 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. [Specific implementation steps based on topic]
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement functionality
4. Verify tests pass

**How to verify:**
```bash
go test ./pkg/... -v
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Tests passing
- Code coverage maintained
- No regressions
