# Day 020: Property normalization

**Month 13:** Intermediate Representation (IR) Design
**Phase:** Multi-Target
**Week:** 3 of 4 - AST → IR Transformation

---

## 🎯 Today's Goal

Continue working on Property normalization with focus on deep work activities.

**What You'll Build:** Property normalization implementation with comprehensive tests

---

## 📚 What You'll Learn Today

**IR Theory, LLVM Study:**
- Core concepts for Property normalization
- Implementation patterns and best practices
- Testing strategies
- Integration with existing Konfiguru architecture

**Go Skills:**
- Advanced patterns (visitor, builder, strategy)
- Interface design for extensibility
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

## ✅ Today's Tasks

### Task 1: Property normalization - Part 1 (80 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. [Specific implementation steps based on topic]
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement functionality
4. Verify tests pass

**How to verify:**
```bash
go test ./pkg/... -v
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Tests passing
- Code coverage maintained
- No regressions
