## ✅ Tasks

### 1. Morning Review (15 min)
- Review yesterday's progress
- Check what you learned
- Identify any blockers

### 2. Main Work (135 min)
**Core Task:** Test cycle detection with complex cycles

**Approach:**
- Break down the task into smaller steps
- Follow TDD: write tests first when coding
- Document as you go
- Commit frequently (every working increment)

### 3. Testing & Validation (15 min)
- Run all tests
- Verify the implementation works
- Check code quality (go fmt, go vet)

### 4. Documentation (15 min)
- Update code comments
- Update learning journal
- Note any challenges or insights

## 💡 Tips for Today

1. **Start Small:** Break the task into 15-30 min chunks
2. **Test Early:** Don't write 100 lines before first test
3. **Commit Often:** Each working increment deserves a commit
4. **Ask for Help:** If stuck >30 min, seek help (community, AI, docs)
