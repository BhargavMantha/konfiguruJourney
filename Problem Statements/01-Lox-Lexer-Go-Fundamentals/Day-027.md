# Month 2 Parser Preparation Notes

## Key Concepts from CI Chapter 5: ASTs

### What is an AST?
[Your notes - what did you learn?]

### Example: Expression Tree
```
    Expression: 1 + 2 * 3

    Tree structure:
           +
          / \
         1   *
            / \
           2   3
```

### Visitor Pattern
- Purpose: [Your understanding]
- How it works: [Notes]
- Why needed in Go: [How interfaces apply]

## Key Concepts from CI Chapter 6: Parsing

### Grammar Rules
[Your notes on grammar notation]

### Operator Precedence
[How does precedence work?]

### Recursive Descent
- What: [Definition in your words]
- Why recursive: [Explanation]
- Connection to grammar: [How they relate]

## Questions/Confusions
1. [Question you have]
2. [Another question]

## Things to Review Before Starting Month 2
- [ ] Tree data structures in Go
- [ ] Interfaces and visitor pattern
- [ ] Recursive functions
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Read CI Chapter 5 completely
- [ ] Read CI Chapter 6 completely
- [ ] Took detailed notes
- [ ] Drew at least 2 AST examples by hand
- [ ] Understand how lexer feeds into parser
- [ ] Identified questions to answer

---

### 2. Understand AST Concepts Practically (60 min)

**Objective:** Make ASTs concrete by drawing and visualizing them.

**Exercise 1: Draw ASTs by Hand**

For each expression, draw the AST:

```
1. 5 + 3
2. 10 * 2 + 3
3. (10 + 2) * 3
4. 5 + 3 * 2 - 1
5. (5 + 3) * (2 - 1)
```

Save drawings (photo or digital) in `docs/learning-notes/ast-practice/`

**Exercise 2: Understand Precedence**

Why does `2 + 3 * 4` equal `14` and not `20`?

Draw both trees:
- Tree 1: If we parse left-to-right (wrong: (2+3)*4)
- Tree 2: If we respect precedence (correct: 2+(3*4))

**Exercise 3: Visitor Pattern in Go**

Read Go interfaces tutorial and understand this pattern:

```go
// Example visitor pattern structure
type Expr interface {
    Accept(visitor ExprVisitor) interface{}
}

type ExprVisitor interface {
    VisitBinaryExpr(expr *Binary) interface{}
    VisitLiteralExpr(expr *Literal) interface{}
}
```

Write notes explaining why this pattern is useful.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Drew 5+ ASTs by hand
- [ ] Understand operator precedence
- [ ] Can explain why precedence matters
- [ ] Understand visitor pattern basics
- [ ] Know how to represent trees in Go

### 3. Plan Month 2 Approach (30 min)

**Objective:** Create a personal learning strategy for Month 2.

**Create plan:** `docs/learning-notes/month-2-personal-plan.md`

```markdown
# My Month 2 Learning Plan

- Design expression nodes
- Implement visitor pattern
- Create AST printer

### Week 2 (Days 38-44): Expression Parsing
- Parse literals and grouping
- Parse binary operators
- Handle precedence

### Week 3 (Days 45-51): Statement Parsing
- Parse print statements
- Parse variable declarations
- Parse blocks

### Week 4 (Days 52-60): Control Flow & Polish

## 💡 Key Learning Points

### Lexer vs Parser

**Lexer (Month 1):**
- Input: String of characters
- Output: Stream of tokens
- Answer: "What are the words?"

**Parser (Month 2):**
- Input: Stream of tokens
- Output: Abstract Syntax Tree
- Answers: "What is the structure/meaning?"

### Why ASTs Matter

An AST is the bridge between syntax (what the code looks like) and semantics (what it means).

```
Code: "1 + 2 * 3"
       ↓ Lexer
Tokens: [NUMBER 1] [PLUS] [NUMBER 2] [STAR] [NUMBER 3]
       ↓ Parser
AST:       +
          / \
         1   *
            / \
           2   3
       ↓ Interpreter
Result: 7
```

### Grammar and Precedence

**Grammar** defines what is valid syntax.
**Precedence** defines what happens first.

Example: `2 + 3 * 4`
- Grammar says: Both + and * are valid
- Precedence says: * before +
- Result: `2 + (3 * 4) = 14`

## 🌉 Bridging to Month 2

You're transitioning from tokenization to parsing. This is exciting!

**What you've built:** Scanner that recognizes words
**What you'll build:** Parser that understands sentences

Think of it like:
- **Lexer:** Identifies words in "The cat sat."
- **Parser:** Understands subject-verb-object structure

**You're building a compiler. This is real computer science!**

---

*Progress: 27/30 days complete* ⭐

**Note:** Reading and prep work are crucial. Don't skip this! Understanding theory before coding makes Month 2 much smoother.
