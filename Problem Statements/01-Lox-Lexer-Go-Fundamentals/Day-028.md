### 2. Set Up Month 2 Git Workflow (30 min)

**Objective:** Prepare Git branches and workflow for Month 2.

**Action Items:**

```bash
# Review current status
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Create Month 2 branch (optional workflow)
git checkout -b month-2-parser

# Or continue on master with good commits
git checkout master
```

**Create Git workflow doc:** `docs/git-workflow.md`

```markdown
# Git Workflow for Konfiguru

## Branch Strategy

**Simple approach (recommended for learning):**
- Work on `master` branch
- Make frequent, small commits
- Each commit should be working code
- Use conventional commit messages

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `test:` Add/update tests
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `docs:` Documentation
- `chore:` Maintenance

**Examples:**
```
feat: add Binary expression AST node
test: add tests for expression parsing
refactor: simplify parser error handling
docs: document visitor pattern usage
```

## Daily Workflow

1. Start day: Review yesterday's commit
2. Make changes: Small, focused
3. Test: Ensure tests pass
4. Commit: Clear message
5. End day: Push to GitHub

## When to Commit

- After completing a task
- When all tests pass
- Before taking a break
- End of coding session

**Commit often!** Small commits are easier to understand and debug.
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Git workflow documented
- [ ] Understand commit strategy
- [ ] Branches set up (if using)
- [ ] Ready to start Month 2

---

### 3. Environment & Tools Check (30 min)

**Objective:** Ensure development environment is ready for Month 2.

**Checklist:**

#### Go Environment
```bash
# Verify Go version
go version  # Should be 1.21+

# Test build still works
go build ./...

# Test suite passes
go test ./...

# Check for updates
go list -m -u all
```

#### IDE Setup
- [ ] VSCode (or your IDE) working
- [ ] Go extension installed and updated
- [ ] Code completion working
- [ ] Test runner working
- [ ] Debugger configured (optional but helpful)

#### Documentation Access
- [ ] Crafting Interpreters book accessible
- [ ] Go documentation bookmarked
- [ ] Obsidian notes set up for Month 2
- [ ] Linear issues ready (if using)

#### Learning Resources
- [ ] CI Chapters 5-6 read (from Day 27)
- [ ] AST practice drawings done
- [ ] Visitor pattern understood
- [ ] Parser videos watched (optional)

#### Mental Preparation
- [ ] Excited about building parser?
- [ ] Understand what you're building?
- [ ] Time blocked for Month 2?
- [ ] Support system aware of commitment?

## 🎯 Ready for Month 2

You've now:
- ✅ Built a complete lexer
- ✅ Reflected on learnings
- ✅ Read about parsers
- ✅ Planned Month 2 approach
- ✅ Set up environment

**You're ready!** Month 2 will build on everything you've learned. The parser takes your tokens and gives them meaning.

**Remember:** You built a lexer from scratch. You can build a parser too!

*Progress: 28/30 days complete* ⭐

**Note:** Good planning makes execution easier. Take time to prepare properly - it's an investment, not a waste!
