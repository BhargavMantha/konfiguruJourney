   - Efficiency insights

5. **Reflections**
   - What went well
   - Challenges encountered
   - Lessons learned
   - How you overcame difficulties

6. **What's Next**
   - Month 2 preview

- [ ] Next month goals clearly outlined
- [ ] Celebration of achievements included

**Verification:**
```bash
# Create the document
cat docs/month-1-completion.md

# Commit
git add docs/month-1-completion.md
git commit -m "docs: add Month 1 completion report with reflections"
```

- Update any outdated references
- Add missing documentation where needed

**Files to review:**
- `README.md`
- `docs/month-1-completion.md`
- `docs/plans/2025-11-15-month-1-go-setup-lox-lexer.md`
- Any inline code comments that need clarification

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All documentation reviewed
- [ ] No broken links or references
- [ ] Code examples tested and verified
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Professional tone maintained

## 💡 Key Learning Points

### Why Documentation Matters

1. **Portfolio Value**
   - Good docs demonstrate professionalism
   - Shows communication skills
   - Makes projects accessible to others

2. **Future You**
   - You'll forget details in weeks/months
   - Clear docs help you resume work quickly
   - Tracks your learning progress

3. **Learning Tool**
   - Writing solidifies understanding
   - Reflection reveals gaps in knowledge
   - Documents decision-making process

### Documentation Tips

- **Be specific:** "50+ tests" not "many tests"
- **Include examples:** Show don't just tell
- **Be honest:** Document challenges, not just successes
- **Think user-first:** What would someone need to know?
- **Keep it current:** Update as you build
