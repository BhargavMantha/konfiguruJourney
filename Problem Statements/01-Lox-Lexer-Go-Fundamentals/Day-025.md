24-month journey to mastering compiler design and infrastructure as code.

**Achievements:**
- Implemented full tokenizer with 50+ tests (85% coverage)
- Applied TDD methodology throughout development
- Followed Go best practices and idioms
- Created interactive REPL and file scanner

**Learning:** Following "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom, building
practical compiler knowledge from first principles.

```

#### Create Screenshots

Take screenshots for portfolio:

1. **REPL in action:**
```bash
./lox
> var x = 10;
> var y = 20;
> print x + y;
```

2. **Test output:**
```bash
go test ./... -v
```

3. **File scanning:**
```bash
./lox examples/test.lox
```

Save in `docs/screenshots/` folder.

#### LinkedIn Post Draft

Prepare a LinkedIn post:

```markdown
Completed Month 1 of my compiler journey! 🎉
