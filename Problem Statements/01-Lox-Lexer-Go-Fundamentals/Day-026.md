## Breakthrough Moments

### "Aha!" Moments

Describe 2-3 moments when concepts suddenly clicked:

**Example:**
"Day 15: When implementing lookahead for two-character tokens, I suddenly
understood why peek() and match() exist. It's not just reading ahead - it's
conditional consumption! This pattern appears everywhere in parsing."

### Debugging Victories

Describe 1-2 tough bugs you solved:

**Example:**
"Spent 2 hours on unterminated string test failing. Finally realized I wasn't
tracking line numbers inside multiline strings. Fixed by adding line++ in
scanString when seeing \\n. Learned: Always test line tracking!"

### 3. Knowledge Consolidation (30 min)

**Objective:** Create quick reference materials for future use.

**Create cheat sheet:**

`docs/cheatsheets/lexer-patterns.md`:

```markdown
# Lexer Implementation Patterns

## Core Scanner Structure

```go
type Scanner struct {
    source  string
    tokens  []Token
    start   int
    current int
    line    int
    errors  []string
}
```

## Essential Methods

**Advancing:**
```go
func (s *Scanner) advance() byte {
    char := s.source[s.current]
    s.current++
    return char
}
```

**Lookahead:**
```go
func (s *Scanner) peek() byte {
    if s.isAtEnd() {
        return 0
    }
    return s.source[s.current]
}

func (s *Scanner) match(expected byte) bool {
    if s.isAtEnd() || s.source[s.current] != expected {
        return false
    }
    s.current++
    return true
}
```

## Common Patterns

**Two-character tokens:**
```go
case '!':
    if s.match('=') {
        s.addToken(BANG_EQUAL)
    } else {
        s.addToken(BANG)
    }
```

**String literals:**
```go
func (s *Scanner) scanString() {
    for s.peek() != '"' && !s.isAtEnd() {
        if s.peek() == '\n' {
            s.line++
        }
        s.advance()
    }

    if s.isAtEnd() {
        s.addError("Unterminated string.")
        return
    }

    s.advance() // Closing "
    value := s.source[s.start+1 : s.current-1]
    s.addTokenLiteral(STRING, value)
}
```

**Numbers:**
```go
func (s *Scanner) scanNumber() {
    for isDigit(s.peek()) {
        s.advance()
    }

    if s.peek() == '.' && isDigit(s.peekNext()) {
        s.advance() // Consume '.'
        for isDigit(s.peek()) {
            s.advance()
        }
    }

    text := s.source[s.start:s.current]
    value, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(text, 64)
    s.addTokenLiteral(NUMBER, value)
}
```

**Identifiers & keywords:**
```go
func (s *Scanner) scanIdentifier() {
    for isAlphaNumeric(s.peek()) {
        s.advance()
    }

    text := s.source[s.start:s.current]
    tokenType := LookupIdent(text)
    s.addToken(tokenType)
}
```

## Testing Patterns

**Table-driven test:**
```go
tests := []struct {
    source   string
    expected TokenType
}{
    {"var", VAR},
    {"123", NUMBER},
}

for _, tt := range tests {
    scanner := NewScanner(tt.source)
    // ... test logic
}
```

## Remember

- Always check `isAtEnd()` before peeking
- Track line numbers for multiline constructs
- Use `match()` for conditional consumption
- Keyword lookup happens after identifier scan
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Cheat sheet created
- [ ] Key patterns documented
- [ ] Code examples included
- [ ] Quick reference ready

   - What obstacles recur?

3. **Builds Confidence**
   - See how far you've come
   - Recognize actual progress
   - Combat imposter syndrome

### Meta-Learning Skills

**Learning to learn is more valuable than any specific skill.**

## 🎯 The Power of Reflection

**"We do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience."** — John Dewey

Taking time to reflect is NOT wasted time. It's an investment that:

- Makes future learning faster
- Prevents repeating mistakes
- Builds self-awareness
- Increases retention

Month 1 is complete. Take time to appreciate your progress!

*Progress: 26/30 days complete* ⭐

**Note:** This is NOT a light day. Deep reflection is hard work, but it's incredibly valuable. Be honest, be thorough!
