## Reflection

[Write 2-3 paragraphs about what this achievement means to you]

Example:
"Completing Month 1 represents more than just writing code. It's proof that
I can commit to a long-term learning journey and follow through. Building a
lexer from scratch taught me that compiler design, once mysterious, is actually
a series of logical steps. I'm proud of maintaining consistency over 30 days
and building something real.

The most valuable learning wasn't technical - it was discovering my learning
style works. TDD saved me debugging time. Small commits helped track progress.
Daily work, even just an hour, built momentum. These meta-learnings will serve
me for all 24 months.

I'm excited for Month 2. Parsers seem complex now, but so did lexers 30 days
ago. If I can build a lexer, I can build a parser. Let's go!"

```
Completed Month 1 of my compiler learning journey! 🎉

Just finished building a complete lexical analyzer for the Lox programming
language in Go. This is the foundation of my 24-month plan to become a
Platform Architect by building a production infrastructure-as-code compiler.

What I built this month:
✅ 300 lines of production Go code
✅ 50+ comprehensive tests (85% coverage)
✅ Interactive REPL for testing
✅ Complete tokenizer handling all Lox syntax
✅ File scanning with error reporting

Key learnings:
• Go's simplicity makes it perfect for compiler work
• Test-driven development saved countless debugging hours
• Lexical analysis is fascinating - turning text into structured tokens!
• Consistent daily work (13.5 hrs/week) beats sporadic bursts
• Building a compiler is totally doable!

Following "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom - highly recommend for
anyone interested in how programming languages work.

Next up (Month 2): Building the parser to convert tokens into an Abstract
Syntax Tree. The journey from "what are the words?" to "what do they mean?"

Thanks to everyone who supported this learning journey!
