### Task 2: Comprehensive Manual Testing (45 minutes)

**Test every feature manually:**

**1. REPL Testing:**
```bash
./lox
```

Try these commands:
```
> help
> var x = 5;
> print "hello";
> var y = 10 + 5 * 2;
> if (x > 3) { print "yes"; }
> for (var i = 0; i < 3; i = i + 1) { print i; }
> fun greet(name) { return "Hello, " + name; }
> class Point { fun init(x, y) { this.x = x; } }
> @invalid
> "unterminated
> history
> clear
> exit
```

**2. File Scanning Testing:**
```bash
# Test all examples
for file in examples/*.lox; do
    echo "Testing $file"
    ./lox "$file"
done

# Test with verbose mode
./lox -v examples/fibonacci.lox

# Test error handling
echo 'var x = "unterminated' | ./lox
```

**3. Edge Cases:**
```bash
# Empty file
touch /tmp/empty.lox
./lox /tmp/empty.lox

# Very long line
echo "var x = $(printf 'a%.0s' {1..1000});" > /tmp/long.lox
./lox /tmp/long.lox

# File doesn't exist
./lox nonexistent.lox
```

**Document any issues found!**
