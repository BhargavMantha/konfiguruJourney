## ✅ Today's Tasks

### Task 1: Module design - Part 1 (60 minutes)

**What to do:**
1. [Specific implementation steps based on topic]
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement functionality
4. Verify tests pass

**How to verify:**
```bash
go test ./pkg/... -v
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Tests passing
