## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Certification Failure
**Mitigation:** Allow 2 weeks for prep, take practice exams, schedule exam for Day 21 (3 days buffer before month end)

### Risk 2: Release Blockers
**Mitigation:** Start testing Week 1, identify blockers early, have backup plan for minor bugs (document as known issues)

### Risk 3: Low Community Interest
**Mitigation:** Prepare compelling demo video, create GitHub README with animated GIFs, engage with communities early
