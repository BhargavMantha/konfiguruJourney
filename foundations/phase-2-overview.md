# Phase 2: Integration (Months 4-6)

> **Master Kubernetes, build your first real compiler, and earn your CKA certification**

---

## 🎯 Phase Goal

Apply your compiler knowledge to infrastructure by building a mini-compiler that generates Kubernetes YAML from a simple DSL. Earn industry-recognized CKA certification.

**Target Role:** Staff Engineer Level
**Timeline:** 3 months (90 days)
**Time Commitment:** 13.5 hours/week

---

## 📚 What You'll Build

### Mini-Compiler v0.1 (~800 lines of Go code)

A practical compiler that transforms a simple DSL into production-ready Kubernetes manifests.

**Example:**
```
service WebApp {
  image: "nginx:latest"
  port: 80
  replicas: 3
}
```

**Generates:** Complete Kubernetes Deployment + Service YAML
