# Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

> **Build your first complete interpreter while learning Go from scratch**

---

## 🎯 Phase Goal

Master compiler fundamentals by building a complete interpreter for the Lox programming language. By the end of this phase, you'll understand lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, and runtime interpretation.

**Target Role:** Staff Engineer Level
**Timeline:** 3 months (90 days)
**Time Commitment:** 13.5 hours/week

---

## 📚 What You'll Build

### Lox Interpreter (~2,000 lines of Go code)

A complete, working interpreter that supports:
- Variables and expressions
- Control flow (if/else, while, for)
- Functions and closures
- Classes and inheritance
- Full test coverage

---

## 🗓️ Month-by-Month Breakdown

### [Month 1: Lox Lexer & Go Fundamentals](month-01/README.md)
**Focus:** Tokenization and Go basics

Learn Go while building a lexer that breaks source code into tokens.

**Deliverable:** ~300 lines of production code + ~400 lines of tests

### [Month 2: Lox Parser & AST](month-02/README.md)
**Focus:** Parsing and tree structures

Build a recursive descent parser that constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree.

**Deliverable:** ~500 lines of parser code with complete AST

### [Month 3: Lox Interpreter Complete](month-03/README.md)
**Focus:** Runtime interpretation

Implement the runtime environment, closures, and complete the interpreter.

**Deliverable:** ~2,000 total lines, fully working interpreter
