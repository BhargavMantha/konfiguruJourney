# Phase 3: Core Konfiguru Compiler (Months 7-12)

> **Build a production-grade DSL compiler with type system, semantic analysis, and code generation**

---

## 🎯 Phase Goal

Design and implement the complete Konfiguru DSL compiler targeting Kubernetes. This phase transforms you from someone who understands compilers to someone who builds production compilers.

**Target Role:** Senior Staff Engineer Level
**Timeline:** 6 months (180 days)
**Time Commitment:** 13.5 hours/week
