# Phase 4: Multi-Target Compiler (Months 13-18)

> **Transform your compiler to support Kubernetes, Terraform, and CloudFormation**

---

## 🎯 Phase Goal

Evolve Konfiguru from a single-target to a multi-target compiler using intermediate representation. Add Terraform and CloudFormation backends while maintaining code quality.

**Target Role:** Staff Architect Level
**Timeline:** 6 months (180 days)
**Time Commitment:** 13.5 hours/week

---

## 📚 What You'll Build

### Konfiguru v0.8 (~10,450 new lines)

A multi-backend compiler featuring:
- Intermediate Representation layer
- Terraform HCL backend (~2,500 lines)
- CloudFormation backend (~1,400 lines)
- Unified CLI with target selection
- Cross-platform consistency guarantees
